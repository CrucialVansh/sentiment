- Though the initial project idea was to just classify movie revies, expansion into a general review classifier is a very valid project
- I will first start by doing research into text processing, please find a review of my finding in reports
- I finished a foundational model that uses TF-IDF to vectorise the reviews and uses Logistic Regression to classify them
- This is limited in its reach as there is no context used when vectorising the reviews, so where a review mentions "not bad" it may see that as negative conotation
