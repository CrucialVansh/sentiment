- I was able to find lectures for a standford course on NLP with deep learning
- Vectorization is technique to map words into vector space in accordance to thier relation and simularity
- A way to set things of, I looked into TF-IDF which is vectorization technique that has been used for NLP since 1970-80s
- TF-IDF calculates the Term Frequency (TF) measuring how often a word appears in document and mulitplies with the Inverse Document Frequency which importance of words accross the collection of documents. 
 - Used the Skikit-learn documents to see how to work with texts
